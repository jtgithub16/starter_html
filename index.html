            Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. <br>If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. <br>He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.

                Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves her veggies and refuses to eat anything dropped on the ground. <br>She makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by complaining in a loud, distinguished manner. <br>If what she says could be translated, it probably would be, “This is atrocious, the water container has been empty for the 3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic disorder intentionally brought upon by humans. <br> I highly advise against keeping a Scottish fold because they are in constant pain when they reach around 2 years old. <br>Cartilage accumulates around her paw joints and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even walk. <br> She is living evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty while sacrificing the animals’ health.

            <p>Luke is a six-year-old white cat; he is very energetic and likes to play fetch. Luke has one brother named Jesse. Luke’s favorite thing to eat are chicken cat treats.
            </p>
            <p>Luke is very badly behaved. He often jumps up on furniture and drinks out of people’s water glasses. He also steals people’s jewelry and hides it in his bed. <br> Luke knows several commands; he can sit, jump, follow, play fetch, and give people his paw.

                Lucy is a 17-year-old calico that I’ve had since I was 5, she has pretty much grown up with me my whole life. <br> Even though she’s old she’s still kickin’ it and enjoys running around the house at 4am.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her favorite foods include anything but her kibble. She enjoys sunbathing and long naps, along with lots of petting. <br> However, she hates getting her stomach rubbed.

                Jax is a kitten, about five months old that I found this summer at a gas station while traveling to Marquette, Michigan. <br> He was scared and malnourished, crying in the parking lot. <br> I took him with me and after some healthy meals and a trip to the vet he is doing great!
            </p>
            <p>
                My roommates and I just recently moved and Jax has been having a hard time getting used to the large house since we were previously living in a small apartment. <br>Jax is incredibly playful and loves to run around, but when he is sleepy he is happy to be held.            </p>
